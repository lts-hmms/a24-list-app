<h3>Pokédex App</h3>
<p>
Pokédex is a small and easy to use web application. The app loads data from an external API called <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">"PokéAPI"</a> and enables the viewing of details of each Pokémon by click. The App uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript


<h3>Navigation</h3>
Users are enabled to scroll through the list of items and click on each of them to display a modal with further information. 
Via the search form on the right of the navigation bar – after opening it – users can type in the name of a Pokémon or just a few letter: the app dynamically displays all matching items. Any elements that do not match the user input are hidden.
